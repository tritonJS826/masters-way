# RULES

## GIT

- One task - one issue. No need to do some tasks in one issue;
- If the task can be described by items, then we start the items in the description as a numbered list;
- After `"merge squash"` need to create a commit message that combines the description of all commit messages in a branch.

## FILE'S AND FOLDER'S NAMES

- Folder names must start with a small letter;
- Files of settings, main file(index.tsx, index.scss), resources files and files that contain custom hooks must be written with small letters;
- Other files must be started with big letters;
- File names must contain the name of the main entity of this file.

## DOCUMENTATIONS

- The README file in the root folder should contain a description of the project, technologies used, instructions for running the application or other useful information.

## COMMUNICATION

- We should use only English for describe tasks, issues, write comments etc;
- When task starts, we must clearly describe "definition of done" (describe the full functionality of the task, what should be in the end);

## CODE

- We use `UPPER_CASE`, if the value of the constant is known before the code is executed and "hardcoded" (for example, the hexadecimal value for red):

```
const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
```  

- We use lower letters and "camelCase", if the constants are calculated during script execution (we don't know a result before script), but do not change after their initial assignment:  


```
const newResult = a * b; // where a and b - random numbers.
```  


* If we have "magic values" it is better to use constants. The name of the constant should convey the meaning of the number.  


```
const GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT = 9.81;

const potentialEnergy = (double mass, double height) => {
  return mass * height * GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT;
}
```  


- Use `PascalCase` for React components and interface name:  
 

```
import MainPage from "src/pages/mainPage/MainPage";
```  


```
interface SwitchProps {
  ...
}
```  


- Import styles from modules using the "styles" keyword:

```
import styles from "src/component/button/Button.module.scss";
```

- If a function returns JSX, prefix `render` should be added.

```
const renderSomething = () => {
  ...
}
```

## COMMENTS

- All comments must start with big letter;

- JSDoc comments should generally be placed immediately before the code being documented. This kind of comment describes the entities to use. Usually these elements can be found in different files (they are often exported). Also we can use this type of comments in we need to use a multiple comments:  

- All public members should be documented with comments
```
/**
 * Comments
 */
```  

- If we need to comment something in one-line outside of the render block we can use the next format:  
  
```
// Comment
```

## COMMITS

- The commit must match the pattern "issue_type: #issue_number short_issue_description" (Issue type can be one of: feat, fix, docs, test, style, refactor)
