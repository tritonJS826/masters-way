/**
 *   They are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree,
 * log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

     Itâ€™s important to note that error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods,
   and constructors of the whole tree below them. However, error boundaries do not catch errors for:

   Event handlers (for that, you need to use regular try/catch)
   Asynchronous code (e.g., setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
   Server-side rendering
   Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children).
